# The Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns sequences defined as follows:
1. start with any positive integer n.
2. Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
    * if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
   * If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
    
**The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.**

I made collatz conjecture function to administrate how to work...
